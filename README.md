# f1tenth_amr:
This project is based on the [F1Tenth project](https://f1tenth.org/). Refer to their [build documentation](https://f1tenth.org/build) for any additional information that may not be listed here on the repo. Our hope with this project is to learn how to develop autonomous robots and the become proficient with the tools that are used to develop such robots:
1. ROS
1. Isaac Sim (preferably) or another robot simulation tool
1. Sensor fusion algorithms
    - Kalman Filtering
    - Image fusion
    - Depth and Lidar Fusion
1. Signal processing for sensor hardware.
1. Controls for Robotics
1. Computervision


The F1tenth_amr is a autonomous guided car that uses Lidar and camera to navigate the map. The project uses the Robotics Operation System (ROS), and use Issac Sim to simulate the robot.
